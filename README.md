Overview

Business Problem Understanding:

The telecom industry is highly competitive, with customer retention being a critical factor for success. Poor voice call quality is a significant driver of customer dissatisfaction and churn. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has collected extensive data on voice call quality and customer experience through the MyCall app, providing a rich dataset for analysis.

Business Objective:

The primary objective is to leverage the provided dataset to develop predictive models that identify and mitigate factors affecting voice call quality and customer experience. By doing so, the goal is to:
* Improve overall call quality.
* Enhance customer satisfaction.
* Reduce churn rates.
* Optimize network resources.
  
This project aims to investigate the relationship between voice call quality and customer churn by analyzing historical customer experience data (3 months - July ,August, September - Year 2018), with the goal of developing a predictive model that forecasts churn and supports proactive customer retention efforts.
